// Counselor identity resolver. The single entry point every handler uses
// to learn "who is the calling counselor, and which student are they
// operating on right now."
//
// Two paths:
//   1. DEV_BYPASS_AUTH set → return a synthetic counselor + the bypass's
//      activeStudentId, after lazily ensuring the synthetic counselor has
//      `counselor_students` rows for the 4 demo students.
//   2. Otherwise → call `getAuth()` from AuthKit, derive activeStudentId
//      from `counselor_students` (lowest attached studentId for v0.2,
//      since the counselor picker UI is deferred to a follow-up PR per
//      plan §16 "Deferred to follow-up PR"), and verify counselor↔student
//      access via `assertCounselorHasStudent`.
//
// Handlers never read the dev-bypass env var or call `getAuth()`
// directly. They call `requireCounselorContext()`. This is the seam that
// makes the activeStudentId server-resolved, never client-supplied
// (plan §6.1).
